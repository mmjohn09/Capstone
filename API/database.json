      "description": "Loki, a master of deception, convinces Surfer that Thor is up to no good! An epic battle between two powerful forces commences!1st story: The Good, The Bad, And The Uncanny! Loki is plotting to kill his brother Thor when he comes across the Silver Surfer while in his astral form. First, he allows Thor to learn of his plot to kill him. Then he travels to Earth and attacks the Surfer. He soon learns the Surfer's true power and tells him that he has passed his test and he must help defend Asgard from Thor, who plans to take over. He also promises to let him free of Earth if he helps. The Surfer agrees and Loki leaves him at Asgard. The Surfer reaches the dining hall where Thor is located and challenges him. Thor tells him they will talk over dinner and a gladiatorial contest. They seem to think that they should not be enemies but Loki is manipulating the situation. Loki controls one of the gladiators into attacking the Surfer in the name of Thor. The Surfer and Thor begin their battle. Both have incredible power that continues to surprise the other. The Surfer gains the upper hand in the battle but soon realizes that his power has been augmented somehow by Loki and some of his actions may have been partially controlled. When Loki leaves his astral form he is no longer able to manipulate them and they talk it through. The Surfer realizes Thor was not using his full power because he knew of Loki's schemes. Defeated once again, Loki transports the Surfer back to Earth and he remains once again trapped on the planet.",

The Hulk responds to the local’s attempts to subdue him with violence but is eventually coaxed off the battlefield by Rick Jones. Meanwhile, the Earth is about to get several strange new visitors (the Toad Men) who armed with advanced magnetic technology beyond human understanding use a 'magnetic grappler' to lock on to Dr. Banner’s vast scientific mind and land nearby to capture him. Their intention is to capture the smartest man on the planet and force him to reveal how far the planet has come technologically. Bruce and Rick meanwhile are preparing an underground cave with an isolation chamber in which to trap the Hulk each night before the transformation occurs.

When Franklin tries to tell his father about this, he sends him to his mother. While unpacking old things, Sue finds the journal from Franklin’s dreams, reads it and later confronts her husband with her horrible findings. Near Muir Isle, Longshot and Dazzler spot and rescue a shipwrecked sailor. In the meantime, Magneto informs the X-Men that he has learned that Reed Richards has created an experimental device that might save Shadowcat’s life. He intends to talk to the FF. He meets the Things and She-Hulk, who accidentally met each other, and together they and the Torch save a house from breaking down. Nevertheless, the Thing and the Torch mistrust Magneto, as he tells them and Reed of his problem. Reed is torn whether or not to help but finally relents. On way to Muir, he asks Ben whether he is ruthless and learns that his friend considers him so certain that it is a kind of ruthlessness. Ben also refers to the fact that he’s never been wrong before… except for the rocket flight that turned them into the Fantastic Four. Horrified at this and by what he has learned from the journal, Reed sinks into an emotional slump, completely uncertain what to do, aware of the fact that he might condemn Shadowcat either way. After examining her, he refuses to help, claiming that the device is experimental and the risk too high. Magneto refuses to take “no” for an answer, leading to a fight, which is acerbated by Wolverine, who threatens Richards with the words from Franklin’s prophetic dream. </p>",

The Marauder then tells his men to make a getaway with him, and leaves Spider-Man, thinking that blind he can't be a threat to him. Unknown to him, Spider-Man throws a spider-tracer in the direction of the Marauder's voice, which successfully sticks there. The Masked Marauder and his gang manage to get away by using the Tri-Man to distract the police whilst they are taken into a helicopter, before flying off.</p><p>Spider-Man emerges from the bank a minute later, and the police assume that he's in league with the Masked Marauder. Spider-Man blindly shoots out with his webbing, and is successful in covering the police officers so that they can't stop him. He then blindly swings away, but with no idea where he's going or what he can do whilst blinded.</p><p>At Peter Parker's apartment, Betty Brant arrives to see if Peter's okay, since he was supposed to call her the previous night. She meets up with Mary Jane Watson, who is also coincidentally visiting at the same time. The two of them start arguing at first, as both like Peter, before being told by Peter's landlady that Peter hasn't been home all night. The two then head up to Peter's apartment, not knowing that the mysterious Carrion is within.</p><p>Spider-Man is still blindly swinging around, frustrated and worried that his sight hasn't started to return yet. As he keeps going, he hears a police car's radio in the street below, saying that he is a suspect in the Masked Marauder's robbery. Elsewhere in the city, Daredevil also hears the report, and decides to investigate it, as he knows that Spider-Man's no criminal. When Daredevil finds Spider-Man and talks to him, Spider-Man's spider sense tingles, and he instinctively takes a step back, falling off of the edge of the building he's on.</p><p>Daredevil's radar sense reveals to him that Spider-Man stepped off the building, and that his heart is pounding as if he is scared, but Daredevil doesn't know why. As Spider-Man shoots out wildly with his webbing, Daredevil realises that Spider-Man is falling to his death, and is able to save him. He then asks Spider-Man what's wrong, and Spider-Man tells Daredevil that he's become blind.</p>",

      "description": "<p><em>Batman and Robin fight an enormous stone idol!</em></p><p>Batman finds himself on a mysterious Planet with no memory or explanation of how he got there, He is without his utility belt and all his supplies Batman walks the planet with slightly disturbed that he is alone on the planet. Soon Batman discovers an ancient abandoned city surrounded by strange plant life that may be alive and grabs at him. Batman is then helped by Robin (Dick Grayson) who helps save him. Batman asks how he got there something Robin does not answer. As the two roam the planet Batman is sure he is being watched by human eyes they then see a strange four armed statue that is in fact alive and chases the Dynamic Duo. Batman and Robin use a tree trunk to swing over to the other side of a chasm and plan on having the creature put his foot on the other side crush the edge with his own tremendous weight. Robin then pelts the creature with rocks in an attempt to cross the chasm much to Batman’s protest the creature then grabs a boulder and crosses the chasm but crushes the edge and falls into the pit the boulder it was holding strikes Robin killing him. Batman mourns the death of Robin and buries him. Batman continues to walk the planet by himself in a weakened and saddened state. Batman still is sure eyes are watching him but sees a strange reptilian alien creature; Batman not wanting to live let the creature attack him blaming himself for Robin’s death.</p><p>Batman is then shown in a high tech room with a device strapped to his head Robin a military general and a scientist come in the room. Batman disoriented then remembers that he was in fact participating in an experiment for NASA to simulate how an astronaut would react in space by himself before shows mental signs of distress. The next night Batman is at the scientist’s office where he explained that Batman mind was responding to a fear of loneliness he has and the fear that Robin may die are why he hallucinated his death. As Batman leaves the scientist wonders if there are any residual affects to Batman’s psyche.</p><p>As Batman and Robin leave they see the members of the Gorilla Gang escaping from a loan office with bags of money. Batman and Robin briefly fight with the Gang before they run on the beam from a construction crane. As Robin runs on the crane Batman hallucinates that the crane is the creature from his hallucination and throws him and Robin over the edge of the building to prevent the Creature from “Killing” Robin. Batman apologizes to Robin then.</p><p>Batman then has nightmares of the living plants from his hallucination where Dick, Alfred and Ace the Bathound rush into his room and begin to suspect Bruce May not be alright.</p><p>The next night Batman and Robin go to capture the Gorilla gang that is now escaping in a car but Batman hallucinates it’s the same reptilian creature from his mind and believes Robin is dead. Robin then runs to the car to move the criminal’s hands from hitting Batman the criminals Miss Batman but knock him down and escape.</p><p>In the Batcave Bruce Wayne refuses to place Robin in danger any longer and decides to no longer be Batman leaving Robin saddened.</p><p>The next night Robin is to testify on another case and leaves he speaks to the scientist who tells him Batman will be okay under therapy. Batman then gets an emergency call from Commissioner Gordon who tells him that Robin was captured by the Gorilla Gang on his way to testify and left a note to Batman saying Robin will die by dawn for interfering with their robberies. Batman then puts on his costume to go out and save Robin after not finding sufficient information he decides to go to the location where the Gorilla Gang escaped a night ago and brings the Bat-Hound to track the scent down.</p><p>Robin is then seen at dawn strapped to a giant balloon by the Gorilla Gang who are about to strike the chords of the balloon with a axe they then hear a noise in a nearby building they send a member to investigate but Batman comes back instead and disposes of the criminals but one accidentally strikes the chords freeing the balloon. The chords hit Batman who briefly remembers the living plans of his hallucination but overcomes it and throws the axe to the balloon deflating it and saving Robin. Robin says Batman must have recovered and Batman says that it was easy since he only <b>imagined</b> that Robin died but was facing <b>reality</b>.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>The cover is a homage to the cover of <em><a href=\"/baffling-mysteries-7-terror-beneath-the-tides/4000-74706/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-74706\">Baffling Mysteries #7</a></em>.</p>",

      "description": "<p><em>The Vulture may prove to be too strong for young Spidey, as the wall-crawler struggles desperately in \"Spider-Kill\"!</em></p><p>In the previous issue, the Vulture was seeking revenge on Spider-Man for the times he's been defeated in the past. However, in the process of trying to get the Vulture to join his gang, a boss leader named Mr. Morgan was humiliated by the Vulture, and so wants revenge on the Vulture. To achieve this, he's hired the Hitman to kill Spider-Man, thus stopping the Vulture from achieving his vengeance. The Vulture attacks the Hitman, as he can't let that happen. As the two fight, Spider-Man recovers some of his strength, and manages to get out of the building between attacking the Vulture and Hitman. The Hitman tries following, but the Vulture tries attacking him once more. The Hitman overcomes this by spraying him with some gas which causes the Vulture to fly off in pain. During his report to Mr. Morgan, the Hitman reveals that although he was unsuccessful in killing Spider-Man, he did manage to place a tracer on both him and the Vulture.</p><p>At a restaurant nearby which has been seen quite a bit in the last few issues, Flash Thompson and Mary Jane visit it, only to be turned down by the owner, once again insisting that Sha Shan doesn't work there. Meanwhile, Spider-Man returns to where he hid his civilian clothes to find that they've become soaked in the snow, and that the intense cold has frozen that. He heads home and is unlucky enough to find that he's out of clean clothes, and so starts boiling his wet clothes to defrost him. Whilst this is happening, Peter is visited by Flash and Mary Jane, who have come to see if Peter knows what they could do concerning the restaurant where Sha Shan apparently works. Peter has no ideas, and during his conversation loses track of what's happening to his defrosting clothes, which shrink astonishingly.</p><p>Watching Spider-Man's tracer's blip, the Hitman notices that it's been stationary for a while, and that Spider-Man must be settling in for the night. He then sets out to kill Spider-Man and complete his end of the contract. As he heads towards Spider-Man's location, he passes the Vulture, and shoots at him, planning to kill Spider-Man right in front of his eyes. As the Vulture chases the Hitman, who's still heading for Spider-Man's location, Peter hears the commotion just as Flash and Mary Jane leave. He changes to Spider-Man, and starts fighting the Vulture, with the Hitman attacking him whenever he slows down. At one point, it looks as though the Vulture will succeed in killing Spider-Man, and so the Hitman shoots in between the two. However, the shot grazes Spider-Man, and he's knocked off the crane he's on.</p><p>Spider-Man manages to shoot out a webline to save his life, but is seemingly unconscious. The Vulture flies towards him, planning to finish him off once and for all, to which the Hitman watches with glee. The Hitman plans to shoot Spider-Man just as the Vulture reaches him, stealing the Vulture's revenge right in front of his eyes. As he fires the bullet, Spider-Man suddenly reveals that he's not unconscious, and grabs the Vulture with his legs, using him to block the bullet. The bullet doesn't kill the Vulture, but it does short out his power pack, draining the necessary power needed to keep him flying. In the confusion, the Hitman manages to escape as he realises that he's failed.</p>",
