An old woman behind the counter leads the men through the building to a heavily barred door where it is opened by a scientist. Inside the room they find a laboratory. The old woman they've been following removes her face, revealing it was a mask to hide her identity. This young beautiful woman was Agent X-13. Afterwards the men have a seat in an adjacent room with a large window and await the new experiment about to begin. Inside the room they witness a frail young man who volunteered to take part in the procedure next to a scientist by the name of Professor Reinstein. Professor Reinstein injects the young man with a strange seething liquid, moments later the young man isn't so frail as his muscles start to grow. Professor Reinstein displays the now changed man as Captain America, America's savior against the saboteurs, spies, and enemies.",
