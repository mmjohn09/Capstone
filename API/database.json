      "description": "<p><em>Loki, a master of deception, convinces Surfer that Thor is up to no good! An epic battle between two powerful forces commences!</em></p><p><b>1st story: \"The Good, The Bad, And The Uncanny!\"</b></p><p>Loki is plotting to kill his brother Thor when he comes across the Silver Surfer while in his astral form. First, he allows Thor to learn of his plot to kill him. Then he travels to Earth and attacks the Surfer. He soon learns the Surfer's true power and tells him that he has passed his test and he must help defend Asgard from Thor, who plans to take over. He also promises to let him free of Earth if he helps. The Surfer agrees and Loki leaves him at Asgard.</p><p>The Surfer reaches the dining hall where Thor is located and challenges him. Thor tells him they will talk over dinner and a gladiatorial contest. They seem to think that they should not be enemies but Loki is manipulating the situation. Loki controls one of the gladiators into attacking the Surfer in the name of Thor.</p><p>The Surfer and Thor begin their battle. Both have incredible power that continues to surprise the other. The Surfer gains the upper hand in the battle but soon realizes that his power has been augmented somehow by Loki and some of his actions may have been partially controlled. When Loki leaves his astral form he is no longer able to manipulate them and they talk it through. The Surfer realizes Thor was not using his full power because he knew of Loki's schemes.</p><p>Defeated once again, Loki transports the Surfer back to Earth and he remains once again trapped on the planet.</p><p><b>2nd Story: \"The Terror Of Tim Boo Ba\"</b></p><p>Reprinted from <a href=\"/amazing-adult-fantasy/4050-2043/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2043\">Amazing Adult Fantasy</a> #9</p>",
