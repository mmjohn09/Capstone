      "description": "<p><em>He tried to warn us. Ever since the release of the first Trump-for-President trial balloon in 1987, Doonesbury's Garry Trudeau has tirelessly tracked and highlighted the unsavory career of the most unqualified candidate to ever aspire to the White House. It's all there--the hilarious narcissism, the schoolyard bullying, the loathsome misogyny, the breathtaking ignorance; and a good portion of the Doonesbury cast has been tangled up in it. Join Duke, Honey, Earl, J.J., Mike, Mark, Roland, Boopsie, B.D., Sal, Alice, Elmont, Sid, Zonker, Sam, Bernie, Rev. Sloan, and even the Red Rascal as they cross storylines with the big, orange airhorn who's giving the GOP such fits. Garry Trudeau is the \"sleazeball\" \"third-rate talent\" who draws the \"overrated\" comic strip Doonesbury, which \"very few people read.\" He lives in New York City with his wife Jane Pauley, who \"has far more talent than he has.\"</em></p><p><strong>Note</strong>: The digital edition (7/5/2016) for this volume was released before the print edition.</p>",
